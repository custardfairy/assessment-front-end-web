    <h2>Intellectual Nomad</h2>
    <p>Greetings! I'm Holly: a magpie collector of puns, data, philosophy, and shiny art.  I grew up in the deepest coal fields of Appalachia but have called Michigan my home since 2005. I attended Marshall University in West Virginia to earn a degree in English Education with a secondary emphasis in World History. Degree aside, my career began in online customer service and transitioned into support and data analytics.</p>
    <h4>My long and random list of interests include:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Board Games</li>
        <li>Political Activism & Intersectional Feminism</li>
        <li>Genre Fiction</li>
        <li>Cooking</li>
        <li>Gardening</li>
        <li>Mixed Media Art</li>
        <li>Playing Instruments</li>
        <li>Singing with Others</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Career Goals</h4>
    <p>As someone fascinated by data, I'm compelled to follow a career path that has data at its center.  Similarly, I enjoy writing useful and clean code that automates dreary tasks or helps remove challenges from someone's day. While providing technical support for customers in the data security sphere, I became interested in the backend workings of Javascript and Python and set out to learn both. I'm excited to find that coding is similar to writing poetry - yet another interest of mine.</p>
